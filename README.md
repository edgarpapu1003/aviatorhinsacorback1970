## 1. What is the Aviator Game? 🎲

Aviator is an exciting crash game that offers players a unique betting
experience. The game features a plane that takes off, and players place
bets on how high the plane will fly before it crashes. The longer the
plane stays in the air, the higher the potential payout. However, if it
crashes before you cash out, you lose your bet. This element of risk
keeps players on the edge of their seats!
